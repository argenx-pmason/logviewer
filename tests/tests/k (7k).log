1          *** This code is written in SAS since it just populates tables for the Proof of
1        ! Concept.
2          	I would suggest that SAS be used to do this, unless it is easy to write data
2        ! manipulation like this in SQL/Server.
3          	The content of the tables can be moved to SQL/Server for their Proof of Concept.
