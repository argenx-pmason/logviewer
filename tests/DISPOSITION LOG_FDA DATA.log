60
61   2011-02-24 DK  Moved every section into separate macros
62                  Collapsed time to event code into one macro for both all and
62 ! exposed
63                  Added checks for all variables
64
65   2011-03-05 DK  Added grouping & subsetting output
66                  Added handling for missing study day/date variables
67                  Number of DSDECOD terms now stored in separate macro variables
67 ! for all vs ex
68
69   2011-03-27 DK  Added run location handling
70
71   2011-04-24 DK  Fixed an error in determining the number of randomized subjects
72                  when DSCAT and DSSCAT are missing; now determined by looking at
72 !  DM_DS/DM_DS_EX
73
74   2011-05-08 DK  Error/no subjects in DM handling
75
76   2011-05-10 DK  Fixed substr to extract dates, order of sort variables, arm
76 ! name length,
77                  by_ds2_one datastep where statement to prevent using missing
77 ! values in a do loop
78
79   2011-05-18 DK  Changed sort in %ds_by_arm to by dsdy instead of dsstdtc/dsstdy
80
81   2011-05-23 DK  Added exceptions in the data step that keeps one dsdecod per
81 ! usubjid/dscat/dsscat
82                  when dsdecod is Informed Consent Obtained or Randomized
83                  Made missing categories/subcategories Missing
84
85   2015-06-13 DC  Enhanced to filter data and graph by dscat and dsscat
